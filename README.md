# No SPAM software
 
In this project we are going to train a neural network to identify SPAM emails. Specifically we are going to:
- Train a classifier to identify SPAM
- Identify the top Topics among the SPAM emails in the dataset
- Calculate the semantic distance between the obtained topics to infer heterogeneity.
- Extract from the NON SPAM emails the Organizations present.
